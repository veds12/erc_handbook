## Importance of Simulation

Simulation is an essential part of Robotics Automation. They provide a versatile
platform to quickly test your code for bugs and performance and try out new ideas.
While robots are becoming more accessible all the time, it is still not at the stage where
you can test your code directly on them. In fact, running code in simulations will always
be more convenient. For a more thorough introduction on simulators and the robots
you can find in them, go through **Chapter 6** of Morgan Quigley.
